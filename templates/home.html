<h2>Welcome Football Fan!<br></h2>

Have you ever been doing a draft simulation, but realized that it skips a step? Unlike the NBA, NFL free agency starts before the draft.
Decisions on whether to retain, trade, extend, restructure, release, or say goodbye to players, and the acquisitions you make on the open .
Free Agent market define your team's draft strategy. Without knowing the moves your team makes,its hard to know which positions
to target. It is even hard to know if you had a good draft situation.<br><br>

This tool takes the guess work out of draft simulating by first simulating the pre-draft offseason.
It is not intended to predict cap casualties or free agent signings.
The purpose is only to randomly provide you parameters by which to draft sim.<br><hr>
