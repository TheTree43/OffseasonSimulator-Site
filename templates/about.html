<h2>About the Offseason Simulator<br></h2>
The first step of the simulator is to make moves that create cap space. The administrator<br>
researched local and national reports, and made educated guesses as to what moves  <br>
will be made. These moves do not change when you re run the simulator<br><br>

The next step is to make the key internal decision. One player from previous year's roster<br>
is highlighted. The simulator will randomly decide this key player's fate. <br><br>

Next, a top external target is identified. The simulator will randomly attempt <br>
to sign or trade for the top target.<br><br>

Finally, depending on the results of the internal decision and top external targer, <br>
the simulator will make a final cut to make cap room to sign the draft class, do nothing,<br>
or sign generic free agents. These unnamed players can be thought of as the second or third <br>
wave of free agents at the listed position. They are decent/average players, who can be <br>
trusted to fill out the starting lineup, or can be used in rotations. <br><br>

After the draft, there will always be final UDFA and veteran signings. These are not mentioned <br>
by the simulator, and are usually camp bodies, with a chance to battle for depth roles.
